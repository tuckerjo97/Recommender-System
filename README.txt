Me messing around with creating recommender systems through various methods.

MF uses matrix factorization through ALS
SVD uses SVD to find latent factors, and clusters around those latent factors
Spark uses pyspark and implicit ALS. Created to try and familiarize myself with spark. It is the main recommender system
file.

None of these files are optimized, and none are heavily tested. All were done with the intended purpose of learning how
a recommender system works, not to be perfect.

Files were created in oder listed, so they should get better as they go on.

Explicit data set used: MovieLens small dataset
Implicit data set used: LastFM 1K user dataset
